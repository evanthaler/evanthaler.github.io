<h1><b>Python for spatial analysis</b></h1>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
After years of using ArcGIS to do spatial analysis, I got tired of the program "not reponding" when I tried to use a tool, only to work after a restart. You might have had similar experiences. Luckily for us, there are open source codes and tools available to replace Arc. If you still like the Arc-style graphical user interface (GUI), <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/"><b>QGIS </b></a>is available. However, there are also a ton of Python packages and functions that can be used to do the same types of analyses. I'll be updating this section of my website to include example codes and walkthroughs for doing some basic spatial analysis in Python. But for now, <a href = "https://github.com/evanthaler/CodeExamples"><b>here </b><a> is a link to some example codes that I've written. Most are heavily commented, but I will comment them more in the future.
